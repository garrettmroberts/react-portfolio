        <p className="card-text">Full-stack web developer making a switch from ministry to computer science.  Recently earned a certification in Full Stack Web Development from Vanderbilt University, where I gained competence in Javascript, CSS3, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB, node.js, and express servers.  Iâ€™ve actively used these skills to design and create full-scale web apps in coordination with remote teams using agile development methods.  In a recent project with two teammates, we designed and deployed a node app that alerts users when they have potentially crossed paths with someone else who has tested positive for Covid-19.   Equipped to work collaboratively either on-site or remotely in a team setting to ensure optimal results for user-centered and technology-centered designs.</p>
